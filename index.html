        <p>Something excited happened. Yeah, this blog was created. (Amazing sound effects!!!!) Now a ceremony of random words and boring stuff will commence. If you continue reading, you may suffer from tramautic seizures of boredom. I don't even know if that's really a thing. Stop reading now. Go to the next post. It might make you want to question your existence on this page. I <em> don't </em> know who you are. But does that really matter??????? DOES IT? No it doesn't. NO. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. OH COME ON. Why is this here. Maybe I'm trying to fill up this space or maybe you're very bored. Oop I missed a comma. Now another! And another! STOP IT! Use commas wisely. Right? are you there... YES I AM. Wait, what? I will now commence a ceremony. Background voices: CEREMONY, CEREMONY, CEREMONY! OF JUSTICE - that was me. Who is me? I don't know either. Or do I? STOP READING. (Continues reading) HTML! OH HTML! YOU HTML! Hey let me sing in the shower alone! No let <em> meee </em> sing in the shower alone. Stop using the em command. What's the em comman you ask? The em command helps italicize stuff in a webpage.</p>

        <p>I can tell the first post doesn't say enough. I have a question for you... why did you click on this blog? What interested you to join. WHY ARE YOU HERE? What is the point? Why is a blog questioning you? Why are you continuously reading? What time is it? IT DOESN'T MATTER, unless it's lunch/dinner time. I'm hungry. Actually, not really. Are you? I think you're more interested in reading this than being hungry? HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAAHAH HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. (Laughter takes over to fill the page.)  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
